Scheduling and Workforce Management
Rota IQ provides AI-powered scheduling tools to assist employers in creating employee schedules. However:

Scheduling Responsibility: Employers are solely responsible for reviewing, approving, and ensuring the accuracy and legality of all schedules generated by the app. Rota IQ does not guarantee that generated schedules will be optimal, error-free, or compliant with all applicable laws or employment contracts.

Algorithm Limitations: The scheduling algorithm is a tool that considers availability, staffing requirements, and other factors, but it may not account for all business-specific needs, preferences, or constraints. Employers should review and adjust generated schedules as necessary.

Time Tracking: Clock-in and clock-out functionality is provided for convenience, but employers are responsible for verifying the accuracy of time records and ensuring compliance with applicable wage and hour laws. Rota IQ is not responsible for payroll calculations or wage disputes.

Availability Management: Employees are responsible for accurately reporting their availability. Employers are responsible for considering employee availability when creating schedules, subject to applicable employment laws and contracts.

Rota IQ is not liable for any scheduling errors, conflicts, or issues that arise from the use of the scheduling features, and employers and employees should resolve scheduling disputes directly between themselves.

Purchases
In General: Periodically, Rota IQ may offer products and services for purchase ("in-app purchases") through authorised payment platforms such as the App Store, Google Play Store, Stripe, or others designated by Rota IQ. When you opt to make an in-app purchase, you will be prompted to confirm your purchase with the relevant payment provider. Your Payment Method (which could be a third-party account like the Google Play Store, App Store, or a credit card processed through Stripe) will be charged for the selected service(s), including any applicable sales taxes, as displayed to you. By proceeding, you authorise Rota IQ or the relevant third-party account to initiate the charge.

Subscriptions: Rota IQ may offer subscription plans for employers to access premium features, increased capacity, or enhanced functionality. Subscription plans may vary in price, features, and duration.

Auto-Renewal and automatic card payments: If you acquire a recurring subscription through an in-app purchase, your Payment Method will continue to be charged until you cancel it. After your initial subscription period ends, your subscription will automatically renew at the agreed-upon price unless canceled before the renewal date. Your card payment information will be stored and used for automatic card payments in accordance with the Agreement and applicable payment processor terms.

Any objections to a payment made should be directed to Support if Rota IQ billed you directly or to the relevant third-party account, such as the App Store or Google Play Store. You can also dispute the charge by contacting your bank or payment provider, who can provide more information on your rights and applicable time limits. You can withdraw your consent to automatic card payments at any time by visiting the relevant third-party account or by canceling your subscription through the app. Please note that you are still responsible for any outstanding amounts.

If you wish to modify or terminate your subscription, the easiest method is to log in to your third-party account (App Store or Google Play Store) and follow the instructions for cancellation, or cancel through the Rota IQ app settings, even if you have previously deleted your Rota IQ account or the Rota IQ application from your device. Deleting your Rota IQ account or the app from your device does not cancel your subscription. Rota IQ will retain all funds charged to your Payment Method until you cancel your subscription on Rota IQ or the third-party account, as applicable. Upon cancellation, you can continue using your subscription until the end of the current term, and it will not renew thereafter.

Refunds: Generally, all charges for purchases are nonrefundable, and no refunds or credits are provided for partially used periods, unless required by applicable law. Exceptions may apply based on the laws of your jurisdiction. To request a refund:
– For purchases made with your Apple ID, Apple handles refunds. Visit the App Store, select your Apple ID, click "Purchase history," locate the transaction, and choose "Report Problem." Alternatively, you can submit a request at https://getsupport.apple.com.
– For purchases made through your Google Play Store account, please contact Google Play Support and provide your Google Play Store order number (found in the order confirmation email or by logging into Google Wallet).
– For purchases made directly through Rota IQ using Stripe or other payment processors, please contact Support and provide your transaction details.
– If you exercise your right of cancellation (where applicable, except for purchases made through your Apple ID or Google Play Store, which are managed by those platforms), we will refund all payments received from you without undue delay and within 14 days from receiving notice of your decision to cancel. The refund will be made using the same payment method as your initial transaction, and no fees will be charged to you as a result.

If you made a purchase through a payment platform not mentioned above, please request a refund directly from the third-party merchant you used for your purchase.

Pricing: Rota IQ operates globally, and pricing varies due to various factors. Promotional rates are frequently offered and can differ based on region, subscription duration, plan features, and other factors. We also regularly test new features and payment options.
